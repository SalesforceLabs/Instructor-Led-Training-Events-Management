# Salesforce App

This guide helps Salesforce developers who are new to Visual Studio Code go from zero to a deployed app using Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI.

## Part 1: Choosing a Development Model

There are two types of developer processes or models supported in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI. These models are explained below. Each model offers pros and cons and is fully supported.

### Package Development Model

The package development model allows you to create self-contained applications or libraries that are deployed to your org as a single package. These packages are typically developed against source-tracked orgs called scratch orgs. This development model is geared toward a more modern type of software development process that uses org source tracking, source control, and continuous integration and deployment.

If you are starting a new project, we recommend that you consider the package development model. To start developing with this model in Visual Studio Code, see [Package Development Model with VS Code](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/package-development-model). For details about the model, see the [Package Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_dev_model) Trailhead module.

If you are developing against scratch orgs, use the command `SFDX: Create Project` (VS Code) or `sfdx force:project:create` (Salesforce CLI)  to create your project. If you used another command, you might want to start over with that command.

When working with source-tracked orgs, use the commands `SFDX: Push Source to Org` (VS Code) or `sfdx force:source:push` (Salesforce CLI) and `SFDX: Pull Source from Org` (VS Code) or `sfdx force:source:pull` (Salesforce CLI). Do not use the `Retrieve` and `Deploy` commands with scratch orgs.

### Org Development Model

The org development model allows you to connect directly to a non-source-tracked org (sandbox, Developer Edition (DE) org, Trailhead Playground, or even a production org) to retrieve and deploy code directly. This model is similar to the type of development you have done in the past using tools such as Force.com IDE or MavensMate.

To start developing with this model in Visual Studio Code, see [Org Development Model with VS Code](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/org-development-model). For details about the model, see the [Org Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/org-development-model) Trailhead module.

If you are developing against non-source-tracked orgs, use the command `SFDX: Create Project with Manifest` (VS Code) or `sfdx force:project:create --manifest` (Salesforce CLI) to create your project. If you used another command, you might want to start over with this command to create a Salesforce DX project.

When working with non-source-tracked orgs, use the commands `SFDX: Deploy Source to Org` (VS Code) or `sfdx force:source:deploy` (Salesforce CLI) and `SFDX: Retrieve Source from Org` (VS Code) or `sfdx force:source:retrieve` (Salesforce CLI). The `Push` and `Pull` commands work only on orgs with source tracking (scratch orgs).

## The `sfdx-project.json` File

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

The most important parts of this file for getting started are the `sfdcLoginUrl` and `packageDirectories` properties.

The `sfdcLoginUrl` specifies the default login URL to use when authorizing an org.

The `packageDirectories` filepath tells VS Code and Salesforce CLI where the metadata files for your project are stored. You need at least one package directory set in your file. The default setting is shown below. If you set the value of the `packageDirectories` property called `path` to `force-app`, by default your metadata goes in the `force-app` directory. If you want to change that directory to something like `src`, simply change the `path` value and make sure the directory you‚Äôre pointing to exists.

```json
"packageDirectories" : [
    {
      "path": "force-app",
      "default": true
    }
]
```

## Part 2: Working with Source

For details about developing against scratch orgs, see the [Package Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_dev_model) module on Trailhead or [Package Development Model with VS Code](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/package-development-model).

For details about developing against orgs that don‚Äôt have source tracking, see the [Org Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/org-development-model) module on Trailhead or [Org Development Model with VS Code](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/org-development-model).

## Part 3: Deploying to Production

Don‚Äôt deploy your code to production directly from Visual Studio Code. The deploy and retrieve commands do not support transactional operations, which means that a deployment can fail in a partial state. Also, the deploy and retrieve commands don‚Äôt run the tests needed for production deployments. The push and pull commands are disabled for orgs that don‚Äôt have source tracking, including production orgs.

Deploy your changes to production using [packaging](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp.htm) or by [converting your source](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_source.htm#cli_reference_convert) into metadata format and using the [metadata deploy command](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_mdapi.htm#cli_reference_deploy).# myTH-Training-Events-Pack

## Features

Use this highly customisable component to give you a dynamic display of world time from any location in your organisation.

This clock component can be shown on any record or app page, or even place it in the utility bar. It can detect location from standard and custom fields or use the system time along with a list of additional locations if desired.

The component also allows for additional cities to be added through the design attributes to give the user ultimate flexibility.

- **Available on App/Record/Utility -** This component can be used on App Pages, Record Pages and even in the Utility Bar.
- **Field flexibility -** Use any standard or custom field on the record to get the local time, for example Billing City or Shipping City.
- **Additional times -** Add additional locations in the design attributes of the component.

## Usage

There are 2 Lightning Components included:

- **[Sample Component 1](#sample-component-1)** - A brief brief description of what this component does.
- **[Sample Component 2](#sample-component-2)** - Another brief description of what this component does.

### Sample Component 1

#### Adding components to a App or Record Page:

Navigate to your app or record page that you want to add the component to and click the cog icon on the top right and select ‚ÄúEdit Page‚Äù see screenshot below.

<div>
	<img src="images/silhouette_placeholder.gif">
</div>

---

This will bring you to the App Builder for the specific page you clicked ‚ÄúEdit Page‚Äù from. Scroll down to the Custom - Managed section on the left hand side component list. From there you can drag the ‚ÄúDynamic World Clock‚Äù component onto any section of the page as shown in the next screenshot below.

<div>
	<img src="images/silhouette_placeholder.gif">
</div>

---

As you can see after dropping the component onto the page, there are a number of configurable attributes to the component. There is an explanation of all the input values depending on which type of page you are using it on [below](#supported-options).

### Sample Component 2

#### Adding components to a Utility Bar

To add the component to the Utility bar of a console app, you will need to know the name of the console app. Once you have that, you can click the cog on the top right of any page and click ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù. From there, type ‚ÄúApp Manager‚Äù in the quick find box and you should be placed on a page like the screenshot below.

<div>
	<img src="images/silhouette_placeholder.gif">
</div>

---

From this page, you will need to find the console app we noted from earlier and click the dropdown action button on the right hand side of its name and press ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù. This will open up the App Builder for the console app. From here we need to click ‚ÄúUtility Items (Desktop Only)‚Äù on the left hand vertical navigation. The resulting page should look like the screenshot below.

<div>
	<img src="images/silhouette_placeholder.gif">
</div>

---

From here, you can click on the ‚ÄúAdd Utility Item‚Äù button. This will give you a list of all available components, but the component we are looking for is the ‚ÄúDynamic World Clock‚Äù component that should be in the ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù section near the bottom. Once you click that, you will be presented with a list of configurable options that are split into two sections, ‚ÄúUtility Item Properties‚Äù & ‚ÄúComponent Properties‚Äù. The ‚ÄúComponent Properties‚Äù are explained in the Design Attributes screenshot above. There are default attributes in place but please feel free to customise these to suit your needs, in particular the ‚ÄúHide System Time‚Äù & ‚ÄúAdditional Time Locations‚Äù fields as they control the locations that are shown in the component. Once you‚Äôre happy with your selections. Please press the save button at the bottom of the page. Screenshot below.

<div>
	<img src="images/silhouette_placeholder.gif">
</div>

---

Once you have saved this page, you can press the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button on the top right of the page which will bring you back to setup. From here use the app launcher to navigate back to your console app to see the component in action.

See the screenshot below for utility bar view of the component and note the ‚ÄúStart Automatically‚Äù attribute in the previous screenshot which makes the component auto pop when the page loads.
